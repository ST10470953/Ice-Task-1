### **README Structure for Android App Development Assignment**

---

1. Basic Information
--------------------

Start with a header section that includes the following basic details:

```markdown
# [Awelani]
- **Developer**: [Awelani Mudau]
- **Student Number**: [ST10470953]
- **Group**: [Group 2]
- **Course**: [HAW5112]
- **Subject**: [Mast]

## Links
- **GitHub Repository**: [Repository URL]


---

2. Project Overview
-------------------

```markdown
## Project Overview

The **[Awelani]** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the [Mobile App Scripting] subject. This application was created using **visual studio** and **GitHub**. The app's primary purpose is to [briefly describe the purpose of the app, e.g., provide a manner to be able to open the app and for it to be able to greet you using your name .].

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.
```



3. App Purpose and Features
---------------------------

```markdown
## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to [the app is able to say hello to the person so we are able to write our own name ]. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: [Description of a feature, e.g., "User functionality"]


These features aim to provide [what the app aims to achieve, e.g., an easy-to-use platform for managing tasks or organizing personal information].
```

4. Design Considerations
------------------------

```markdown
## Design Considerations

The design of the **[App Title]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
3. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.
```

Why:
----
- Highlights the thought process behind the design choices. It demonstrates that students are considering not just the functionality, but also the usability and performance aspects of the app, which is a professional approach.

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------
```markdown
## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the appâ€™s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **html** files which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final transcryipt files for submission.
```

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

```markdown
## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Briefly describe a challenge you faced, e.g., "Implementing a complex feature like having to distrubute it on github."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge, e.g., "I researched Firebase authentication and successfully integrated it into the app."]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Describe another challenge, e.g., "Debugging issues related to Gradle builds."]
   - **Solution**: [Had to restart the terminal all over.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.
